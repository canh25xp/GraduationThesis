\statement{
  This thesis focuses on the development of a web-based application that provides easy access to existing grammatical error correction (GEC) models using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
  It does not introduce a new GEC method nor improve the performance of existing models.
  Instead, the goal is to make state-of-the-art GEC technology more accessible and user-friendly for the general public by integrating these models into an intuitive and lightweight web interface.
