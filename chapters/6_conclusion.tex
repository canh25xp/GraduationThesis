\label{chapter:conclusion}

In this thesis, I have presented GecWeb, a web-based application for GEC that can be easily used by the general public.
GecWeb designed to be accessible to as many users as possible, including users who have a slow Internet connection and who use mobile phones as their main devices to connect to the Internet.
In GecWeb, I provide three base GEC systems using sequence tagging, as well as two GEC system combination methods from two types of approaches, edit-based and text-based combination.
GecWeb is separated into two parts to make the application modular and easily extensible to other base GEC systems.

GecWeb is currently limited to English GEC systems, but it can be extended to other languages by incorporating base GEC models for other languages and modifying the pre-processing and post processing steps.
