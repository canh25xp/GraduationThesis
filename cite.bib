  abstract = "In this paper, we present a simple and efficient GEC sequence
              tagger using a Transformer encoder. Our system is pre-trained on
              synthetic data and then fine-tuned in two stages: first on errorful
              corpora, and second on a combination of errorful and error-free
              parallel corpora. We design custom token-level transformations to
              map input tokens to target corrections. Our best
              single-model/ensemble GEC tagger achieves an F{\_}0.5 of 65.3/66.5
              on CONLL-2014 (test) and F{\_}0.5 of 72.4/73.6 on BEA-2019 (test).
              Its inference speed is up to 10 times as fast as a
              Transformer-based seq2seq GEC system.",
