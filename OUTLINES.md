# 1 Introduction

3-6 pages

## 1.1 Motivation

Highlight the urgency, importance and/or scale of their problem.
Start from real life situation, what causes the problem.
What benefits does the problem, if solved, bring, to whom, and can it be applied to other fields.
This section only presents the problem, do not present the solution.

## 1.2 Objectives and scope of the graduation thesis

Students first need to present an overview of the current available products/user needs in the market.
Next, compare and evaluate the overview of these products.

Based on the above analysis and evaluation, summarize the current limitations they are facing.
On that basis, this thesis will aim to solve specific problems, overcome limitations, develop software with what main functions, create breakthroughs, etc.

Only present an overview, not go into details of the problem or solution.
Detailed content will be presented in the following chapters.

## 1.3 Tentative solution

From the clear identification of the task to be solved in section :1.2, propose the solution :

1. Present which orientation, method, algorithm, technique, or technology they will use to solve the problem;
2. Briefly describe what solution is used in this thesis;
3. Present what the main contribution of the thesis is, what the results are.

Do not to explain or analyze the technology/algorithm in detail in this section, only name the technology/algorithm, briefly describe it in one to two sentences, and quickly explain the reason for the choice.

## 1.4 Thesis organization

The rest of this graduation project report is organized as follows.

Chapter 2 presents ...

In Chapter 3, I introduce ...

Note: Write full paragraph description of the chapter content, do not write ideas or bullet points. Chapter 1 does not need to be described in this section.

Each chapter should have an overview and and conclusion.
The overview should link to the prior chapter and briefly present the reason for the existence and the necessity of this chapter.
Then introduce what issues will be presented in this chapter.

# 2. Requirement survey and Analysis

9-11 pages

## 2.1 Status survey

1. users/customers
2. existing systems
3. similar applications

Conduct a detailed analysis, comparison, and evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of existing products/research.
Create a comparison table if necessary, combined with the user/customer survey (if any), and outline and briefly describe the important software features that need to be developed.

## 2.2 Functional Overview

# 3 Methodology

This chapter is no longer than 10 pages.
If a longer presentation is needed, include it in the appendix.
Note that this is existing knowledge, only analyze and summarize it after learning it.
Do not present it in detail.

Introduce the technologies, platforms or any theoretical foundations used in this thesis.

For each technology/platform/theory presented, clearly analyze which technology/platform/theory is used to solve the specific problem/requirement in Chapter 2.
Furthermore, for each problem/requirement, list similar technologies/approaches that can be used as alternatives, and then clearly explain choice.

Note: The content of the thesis must be coherent, seamless, and consistent.
Therefore, the technologies/algorithms presented in this chapter must match the content introduced the previous section.

In this chapter, to increase the scientific nature and reliability, clearly indicate which source of knowledge they have collected from the document, and at the same time include that document in the list of references and create cross-references.

# 4 Design, Implementation, and Evaluation

## 4.1 Architecture design

### 4.1.1 Software architecture selection

1-3 pages

Choose a software architecture for their application such as: three-tier architecture MVC, MVP, SOA, Microservice, etc.
Briefly explain that architecture.
Using the software architecture selected above, describe the specific architecture for the application: how this thesis apply the general theory to the product, are there any changes, additions or improvements.

### 4.1.2 Overall design

Draw a UML package diagram, clearly showing the dependencies between packages, briefly explain the purpose/task of each package.

### 4.1.3 Detailed package design

Design and draw diagrams for each package, or a group of related packages, to solve a problem.
Clearly draw the relationships between the classes in the diagram.
The relationships include: dependency, association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, and implementation.
After drawing the illustration, briefly explain the design.

## 4.2 Detailed design

### 4.2.1 User interface design

2-3 pages

Specify information about the screen this application is intended for, including screen resolution, screen size, number of supported colors, etc.
Next, present the consistancy/standardization when designing the interface such as button design, controls, feedback message display location, color scheme, etc.
Finally, present some illustrative images of the interface design for the most important functions.

Note: do not confuse the design interface with the interface of the final product.

### 4.2.2 Layer design

3-4 pages

Present detailed design of attributes and methods for some of the most important/main classes of the application (2-4 classes).
Detailed design for other classes, if desired, include in the appendix.

To illustrate the layer design, students design the message flow between participating objects for 2 to 3 important use cases using sequence diagrams (or communication diagrams).

### 4.2.3 Database design

2-4 pages

Design, draw, and explain an entity-relationship diagram (E-R diagram).
From there, design the database depending on the selected database management system (SQL, NoSQL, Firebase, etc.)

## 4.3 Application Building

### 4.3.1 Libraries and Tools

List the tools, programming languages, APIs, libraries, IDEs, testing tools, etc. use to develop the application.
Each tool must be clearly labeled with the version used.

| Purpose | Tools  | URL                            |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| IDE     | VSCode | https://code.visualstudio.com/ |
| ...     | ...    | ...                            |

### 4.3.2 Achievement

List information about the application such as: number of lines of code, number of classes, number of packages, total source code size, size of each packaged product, etc.
Similar to the list of tools used, use a table to describe this statistical information.

### 4.3.3 Illustration of main functions

Select and display the main, important, and most interesting functions.
Each interface needs to have a brief explanation.
When explaining, combine it with the annotations in the interface image.

## 4.4 Testing

2-3 pages

Designs test cases for the 2-3 most important functions, should specify the testing techniques used.
Details of other test cases, if desired, should be included in the appendix.
Finally summarize the number of test cases and test results, analyze the reasons if the test results fail.

## 4.5 Deployment

What server/device is the application deployed on, what is the configuration.
The test implementation results, if any (number of users, number of accesses, response time, user feedback, load capacity, statistics, etc.)

# 5 Solution and Contribution

At least 5 pages.
In case this part is less than 5 pages, include it in the conclusion instead.

Present all the contributions which is the most interesting during the process of doing the thesis.
It can be a series of difficult problems that students have solved step by step, an algorithm for a specific problem, a general solution for a class of problems, or an effective model/architecture designed by students.

This chapter is an important basis for teachers to evaluate this thesis.
Therefore, take time to promote creativity, the ability to analyze, debate, argue, generalize the problem and focus on writing well.
Each solution or contribution should be presented in a separate section consisting of three sub-sections:

1. introduction/problem
2. solution
3. results (if any)

Do not to repeat content that has been presented in detail in previous chapters.
Therefore, for good content that is of a contribution/solution nature, students should only summarize/preliminarily describe it in previous chapters, and at the same time create cross-references to the corresponding topic in Chapter 5. Detailed information about the contribution/solution is presented in that section.

For example, in Chapter 4, students have designed some notable architecture, which is a combination of MVC, MVP, SOA, etc.
The student would then simply describe the architecture briefly in Chapter 4, and then add sentences like: "Details of this architecture will be presented in Section 5.1".

# 6 Conclusion and Future work
